</p>

A cross-platform terminal music player with iPod Classic / Shuffle support,
MOD tracker playback, and a numerology-based track selector, written in Rust.

---

## Features

- Full-featured TUI (ratatui): library browser, player pane, waveform pane, device pane
- Local library scanner: MP3, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG, Opus, WAV, AIFF
- **Magic-byte format verification** — extension mismatches rejected at import time
- **MOD tracker support**: MOD, XM, IT, S3M, MO3 and 20+ legacy formats (optional — see below)
- Real-time **waveform oscilloscope** (`[V]`) — Unicode half-block characters (▀ ▄ █)
- **Live search** (`[/]`) — searches title, artist, album, year, tags, playlists, and filename; shows matched fields inline
- **Gematria track selector** (`[\]`) — type any word or phrase; classic numerology systems compute a value and select a track to play; inspired by [cosmic-knowledge](https://github.com/sormondocom/cosmic-knowledge)
- **Sort & group presets** (`[Z]`): by artist, album, year, month, file extension, or user tags
- **Duplicate finder** (`[F]`): exact-content and metadata-match detection with per-track keep/delete UI
- **User tag library** (`[G]`): tag any track with custom keywords; filter and group by tag
- In-place tag editor (`[E]`): title, artist, album, year, genre
- Playlist badges and tag badges shown inline in the track list
- iPod Classic / Nano / Mini / Shuffle upload via USB Mass Storage
- iTunesDB & iTunesSD read/write — no iTunes required
- iPod health scan and database repair
- **Amazon Music** easter egg — catalog browser and MP3 downloader (session-cookie based)
- Playlists saved as JSON; single-track repeat
- **Ctrl+V paste** in all text input fields (desktop platforms)
- **mpv fallback** for audio playback on Termux (when the native backend is unavailable)

## Platform support

| Platform | Standard audio | Tracker (MOD/XM/IT…) | iPod transfer |
|----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Windows 10/11** (x86-64) | ✅ | ✅ (DLLs bundled) | ✅ |
| **Linux** (x86-64, aarch64) | ✅ | ✅ (`apt`/`dnf`/`pacman`) | ✅ |
| **macOS** (x86-64, Apple Silicon) | ✅ | ✅ (`brew`) | ✅ |
| **Android — Termux** (aarch64) | ✅ via `mpv` | ✅ (`pkg install libopenmpt`) | ⚠️ (USB limited) |

> iPod transfer on Android depends on the device exposing the iPod as USB Mass
> Storage. Many modern Android phones require a USB-OTG adapter and a file
> manager that mounts the device at a known path.

---

## Dependencies

### Required — always (no system libraries needed)

- **Rust 1.75+** — [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
- All audio decoding (MP3, FLAC, AAC, OGG, WAV, AIFF) is handled by
  [symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia) via Cargo — no system
  library required.

### Optional — MOD tracker playback (`--features tracker`)

Tracker playback links against **libopenmpt**, a C++ library.  Install it for
your platform before passing `--features tracker`.

#### Windows

Pre-built DLLs are bundled in `deps/` — no package manager needed.  See
[Setting up deps/ on Windows](#setting-up-deps-on-a-new-machine-windows) in the
Developer Notes section.

#### Linux

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi OS
sudo apt install libopenmpt-dev

# Fedora / RHEL / CentOS Stream
sudo dnf install libopenmpt-devel

# Arch Linux / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S libopenmpt
```

#### macOS

```bash
brew install libopenmpt
```

#### Android — Termux

```bash
pkg install libopenmpt
```

libopenmpt links against Android's shared C++ runtime (`libc++_shared.so`).
The project's `.cargo/config.toml` adds the correct linker flag automatically —
no extra steps needed after the `pkg install`.

---

## Android / Termux setup

### Audio playback

The native audio backend (`cpal`/`rodio`) cannot reach the Android audio system
from a plain Termux terminal process.  `cmp` automatically falls back to **mpv**
as an external audio process.  Install it once:

```bash
pkg install mpv
```

That's it.  When `cmp` starts it probes `PATH` for `mpv` and routes all
playback through it.  Pause, resume, stop, and volume control all work normally.

> **Note:** The waveform oscilloscope (`[V]`) requires the native rodio backend
> and is unavailable on the mpv path.

### Accessing Internal Storage

Android sandboxes Termux away from `/storage/emulated/0` (Internal Storage) by
default.  Run this once to grant access and create the storage symlinks:

```bash
termux-setup-storage
```

Accept the permission popup when prompted.  This creates `~/storage/` with
ready-to-use symlinks:

| Symlink | Points to |
|---------|-----------|
| `~/storage/shared` | `/storage/emulated/0` (full Internal Storage) |
| `~/storage/music` | `/storage/emulated/0/Music` |
| `~/storage/downloads` | `/storage/emulated/0/Download` |
| `~/storage/dcim` | `/storage/emulated/0/DCIM` |

On first launch **`cmp` automatically detects and adds** a music source in this
priority order:

1. `~/storage/music` — the dedicated Music symlink (preferred)
2. `~/storage/shared/Music` — the Music folder inside full Internal Storage
3. `~/Music` — home directory Music folder (fallback)

To add other folders, press `[S]` → `[A]` and enter the path.  Tilde paths
are expanded automatically, so you can type either:

```
~/storage/shared/Podcasts
/storage/emulated/0/Podcasts
```

> If you see *"Not a directory"* when entering a `/storage/...` path, run
> `termux-setup-storage` first and restart `cmp`.

### Quick-start on Termux

```bash
# 1. One-time setup (do this once, ever)
pkg install rust mpv
termux-setup-storage   # accept the permissions popup

# 2. Optional: tracker support
pkg install libopenmpt

# 3. Build and run
cargo build --release
./target/release/cmp
```

---

## Building

```bash
# Full build — tracker included by default (requires libopenmpt — see above)
cargo build --release

# Without tracker — pure Rust, no C++ dep, works anywhere without libopenmpt
cargo build --release --no-default-features

# Run directly from source with a music library path
cargo run -- --library /path/to/Music
```

> **Windows users:** the VS Code default tasks (Ctrl+Shift+B / Ctrl+Shift+P →
> Run Task) build with `--features tracker` and copy the bundled DLLs
> automatically.

> **Termux users:** install libopenmpt first (`pkg install libopenmpt`), then
> `cargo build` gives the full player including tracker support. If you prefer
> not to install libopenmpt, use `cargo build --no-default-features`.

| `N` | Initialise fresh iTunesDB on iPod |
| `U` | Dump iTunesDB contents to transfer log |
| `Q` | Quit |

### Sort / Group-by presets (`Z`)

Pressing `Z` cycles through these presets in order:

| Preset | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| Original Order | Restore initial scan order |
| Artist / Album | Artist → Album → Title (default) |
| Title | Alphabetical by title |
| Album | Album → Title |
| Duration ↓ | Longest tracks first |
| Date Added | Newest file first (by mtime) |
| Group by Extension | Sections: FLAC, IT, MOD, MP3, XM … |
| Group by Artist | Sections per artist name |
| Group by Year | Sections per release year (unknown last) |
| Group by Month | Sections per mtime year · month |
| Group by Tag | Sections per user tag (untagged last) |

### Live search overlay (`/`)

Results update on every keystroke.  Each result shows the track and a badge
indicating which fields matched, e.g. `[Artist · Tag]`.

Fields searched: **Title, Artist, Album, Year, user Tags, Playlist name, File name**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Any character | Append to search query |
| `Backspace` | Delete last character |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste from clipboard |
| `↑` / `↓` or `k` / `j` | Navigate results |
| `Page Up` / `Page Down` | Jump 10 results |
| `Enter` | Jump to selected track in library |
| `Esc` | Close without navigating |

Results are ranked: exact title matches first, then exact artist matches, then
remaining matches in scan order.

### Gematria track selector (`\`)

Select a track to play using numerological values derived from a word or phrase.
The system is ported from the [cosmic-knowledge](https://github.com/sormondocom/cosmic-knowledge)
numerology module.

Type any word, name, or phrase — the overlay computes the gematria value
across four classical systems and maps each result to a track in your library.

| System | Method |
|--------|--------|
| **Hebrew Gematria** (Mispar Hechrachi) | Traditional Hebrew letter values (A=1, B=2, K=20, L=30 …) |
| **Pythagorean** | Western cyclical assignment (A/J/S=1, B/K/T=2 …) |
| **Chaldean** | Babylonian vibrational system (values 1–8 only, no 9) |
| **Simple Ordinal** | A=1 through Z=26 |

The phrase total (not the reduced root) is used as the track index
(`total mod library_size`) so the full numeric value spreads across your entire
library.  The digital root (1–9, preserving master numbers 11, 22, 33) is shown
alongside an interpretive meaning.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Any character | Append to phrase |
| `Backspace` | Delete last character |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste from clipboard |
| `Tab` | Cycle through the four systems |
| `Enter` | Jump to the selected track and play it |
| `Esc` | Cancel, return to library |

The overlay updates live as you type, showing all four system results at once
with the active system highlighted.

### Metadata tag editor (`E`)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `↓` / `j` | Next field |
| `↑` / `k` | Previous field |
| `Enter` | Save tags to file |
| `Esc` | Cancel, discard changes |

Fields: Title, Artist, Album, Year, Genre.

### User tag editor (`G`)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Any character | Append to tag input |
| `Backspace` | Delete last character |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste from clipboard |
| `Enter` | Save tags to disk |
| `Esc` | Cancel, discard changes |

Tags are comma-separated keywords (e.g. `rock, 80s, favourite`).  They are
normalised to lowercase and deduplicated on save.  Tags appear as `#tag` badges
inline in the track list and can be grouped with `Z → Group by Tag`.

### Duplicate finder (`F`)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` or `k` / `j` | Navigate duplicate groups (left panel) |
| `Tab` | Switch focus: group list ↔ candidates |
| `Space` | Cycle action for focused candidate (Keep / Delete) |
| `A` | Auto-suggest best action for all groups |
| `Enter` | Execute all Delete actions |
| `Esc` | Cancel, return to library |

### Waveform oscilloscope (`V`)

Replaces the library pane with a real-time oscilloscope trace of the playing
audio.  Uses Unicode half-block characters (▀ ▄ █ space) for double vertical
resolution.  Press `V` or `Esc` to return to the library.

> Not available when using the mpv fallback backend (Termux without native audio).

### Amazon Music (easter egg)

Type the key sequence `A` → `C` → `E` within 2 seconds from the library screen
to open the Amazon Music catalog browser.  This feature requires a valid
`music.amazon.com` session cookie — you will be prompted to paste one on each
session start (cookies are session-scoped and expire).

**How to get your cookie:**
1. Open `music.amazon.com` in a browser and sign in
2. Press `F12` → Network tab → click any request
3. Under Request Headers, right-click the `cookie:` value → Copy value
4. Paste it into `cmp` with `Ctrl+V` when prompted

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Switch focus: Amazon catalog ↔ Local library |
| `↑` / `↓` or `k` / `j` | Navigate tracks |
| `Page Up` / `Page Down` | Jump 10 tracks |
| `D` | Download focused Amazon track as MP3 |
| `R` | Refresh / re-fetch catalog |
| `?` | Open diagnostic log (full HTTP exchange dump) |
| `Esc` | Close diagnostic log / return to library |

The diagnostic log (`?`) shows the complete untruncated HTTP exchange for any
failed request — method, URL, all request headers, HTTP status code, all
response headers, and the full response body.  This is especially useful for
diagnosing expired-cookie 404 responses where Amazon returns an HTML error page
instead of JSON.

### Text input fields

All text input overlays (Add Source, Save Playlist, tag editors, search,
gematria) support:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Any character | Append |
| `Backspace` | Delete last character |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste from system clipboard |
| `Enter` | Confirm |
| `Esc` | Cancel |

> Clipboard paste (`Ctrl+V`) is not available on Android/Termux — no system
> clipboard service exists in a terminal process.

---

## Track list badges

Each track row can display two types of inline badges:

- **`‹PlaylistName›`** (blue) — the playlists this track belongs to (up to 2 shown; `+N` for overflow)
- **`#tag`** (magenta) — user-defined keywords (up to 3 shown; `+N` for overflow)

Badges are rebuilt automatically whenever playlists or tags change.

---

## Supported tracker formats

| Extension | Format | Generation |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `.mod` | Amiga ProTracker / NoiseTracker | 1987 |
| `.xm` | FastTracker 2 Extended Module | 1994 |
| `.it` | Impulse Tracker | 1995 |
| `.s3m` | Scream Tracker 3 | 1994 |
| `.mo3` | Compressed MOD/XM/IT/S3M | 2001+ |
| `.mptm` | OpenMPT native | 2004+ |
| `.669`, `.amf`, `.ams`, `.dbm`, `.dmf`, `.dsm`, `.far`, `.mdl`, `.med`, `.mtm`, `.okt`, `.ptm`, `.stm`, `.ult`, `.umx`, `.wow` | Various legacy formats | various |

Playback is provided by **libopenmpt** — the reference-quality tracker engine
used by OpenMPT, VLC, and most modern media players that support these formats.

---

## iPod support

Supported models (USB Mass Storage, no iTunes needed):

| Family | DB format | Folder layout |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Classic 1st–6th gen | iTunesDB | `iPod_Control/Music/Fxx/` |
| Mini 1st–2nd gen | iTunesDB | `iPod_Control/Music/Fxx/` |
| Nano 1st–5th gen | iTunesDB | `iPod_Control/Music/Fxx/` |
| Shuffle 1st–3rd gen | iTunesSD | `iPod_Control/Music/` |

iPod touch uses the iOS/AFC protocol and is not supported by this path.

### Windows note

Windows requires iTunes (or the Apple Mobile Device Support package) to be
installed so that the Apple USB driver is available.  The iPod must be mounted
as a drive letter — disk mode is enabled automatically on Classic/Nano/Mini
models when connected.

### Cargo features

| Feature | Default | Effect |
|---------|:-------:|--------|
| `tracker` | **yes** | Enables MOD/XM/IT/S3M playback via libopenmpt |

`tracker` is on by default for the best out-of-the-box experience on desktop
platforms.  Platform-specific build commands:

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Windows / Linux / macOS | `cargo build` (tracker included — install libopenmpt first) |
| Android / Termux with libopenmpt | `pkg install libopenmpt` then `cargo build` |
| Android / Termux without libopenmpt | `cargo build --no-default-features` |

### Gematria module

`src/gematria.rs` is a self-contained numerology engine ported from the
[cosmic-knowledge](https://github.com/sormondocom/cosmic-knowledge) project.
It has no external dependencies beyond the Rust standard library.

**Public API:**

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `compute(phrase) -> Vec<SystemResult>` | Run all four systems against a phrase; returns one result per system |
| `digital_root(n) -> u32` | Reduce to 1–9, preserving master numbers 11, 22, 33 |
| `select_index(total, track_count) -> usize` | Map a system total to a 0-based track index via `total % track_count` |
| `meaning_of(root) -> &str` | Interpretive text for roots 1–9 and master numbers |
| `SystemResult { name, total, root }` | A single system's result |

The `App` state machine in `app.rs` wraps this behind `GematriaState`, which
recomputes live on every keypress and exposes the selected track index directly
to the UI and playback layers.

### Android / Termux — audio backend details

The `cpal` audio backend calls into `ndk-context` to obtain the Android
`AudioManager` Java object.  In a Termux shell process there is no JavaVM, so
this call panics rather than returning an error.  `main()` wraps the call in
`std::panic::catch_unwind` and falls back to `None` (no audio handle).

`Player::new()` detects the missing handle and probes `PATH` for `mpv`.  If
found, all playback routes through an `mpv` subprocess:

- **Spawn:** `mpv --no-terminal --no-video --input-ipc-server=<sock> <file>`
- **Control:** JSON commands over a Unix socket (`{"command":["set_property","pause",true]}`)
- **End-of-track:** detected via `process.try_wait()`
- **Volume:** `set_property volume <0–100>` sent over the socket

The socket file is created in the OS temp dir (`std::env::temp_dir()`) and
cleaned up on stop.  No extra crates are required — `std::os::unix::net` handles
the socket communication.

### Android / Termux — C++ runtime details

libopenmpt is a C++ library.  On Android the only available C++ runtime is the
*shared* one (`libc++_shared.so`); the static variant (`libc++_static`) does
not exist in the Termux NDK environment.  Some transitive dependencies emit a
link directive for `c++_static` even when no C++ code is compiled directly.

Two mechanisms work together to fix this:

1. **`.cargo/config.toml`** — adds `-lc++_shared` for all `android` targets,
   satisfying the C++ runtime requirement through the shared library.
2. **`build.rs`** — when `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS == "android"`, creates an empty
   `libc++_static.a` archive stub in `OUT_DIR` using `ar rcs`, then adds
   `OUT_DIR` to the native link search path.  This satisfies any `link-lib=c++_static`
   directive from transitive deps without providing conflicting symbols.

```
Error: unable to find library -lopenmpt     → pkg install libopenmpt
Error: unable to find library lc++_static   → fixed automatically (build.rs stub)
```

### Android / Termux — Internal Storage access

`~/storage/` symlinks are created by `termux-setup-storage`.  On first launch
`cmp` checks these paths in order and seeds the first one that exists:

1. `~/storage/music` — Termux symlink directly to the Music folder
2. `~/storage/shared/Music` — Music folder inside full Internal Storage
3. `~/Music` — standard home directory fallback

The `add_source` path validates tilde-expanded paths and appends a
`termux-setup-storage` hint when a `/storage/...` or `/sdcard/...` path doesn't
exist yet.  Tilde expansion (`~` → `$HOME`) is handled by `util::expand_tilde`
and applied to all path input fields (Add Source, Amazon download dir).

Clipboard (`arboard`) is excluded on Android via a
`[target.'cfg(not(target_os = "android"))'.dependencies]` entry in
`Cargo.toml`.  The `clipboard_paste()` function returns `None` on Android via
`#[cfg(target_os = "android")]`.

### Windows DLL handling

`libopenmpt.dll` is a load-time dependency when the `tracker` feature is
enabled.  To make this developer-friendly, three mechanisms work together:

**1. `/DELAYLOAD` linker flag** (`build.rs`)

On MSVC targets, `build.rs` adds `/DELAYLOAD:openmpt.dll` and links
`delayimp.lib`.  This defers DLL resolution to the first openmpt call rather
than process start, so `main()` runs even when the DLL is missing.

**2. Runtime DLL probe** (`src/main.rs: check_openmpt_dll`)

`main()` calls `LoadLibraryW("libopenmpt.dll")` before any tracker code
executes.  If the DLL is absent the app prints the exe path, a download URL,
and the `--no-default-features` fallback, then exits with code 1.  No cryptic
OS crash dialog.

**3. Companion DLLs** (`deps/`)

`libopenmpt.dll` itself depends on four companion DLLs that must be present in
the same directory:

| DLL | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `openmpt-mpg123.dll` | MP3 decoding inside tracker files |
| `openmpt-ogg.dll` | Ogg container |
| `openmpt-vorbis.dll` | Vorbis audio codec |
| `openmpt-zlib.dll` | Compression |

`build.rs` copies all five DLLs next to `cmp.exe` on every build.

#### Setting up `deps/` on a new machine (Windows)

```powershell
# Download the Windows dev package from lib.openmpt.org/libopenmpt/download/
# Use the file named libopenmpt-*-dev.zip (not the plain bin zip).
#
# Extract these files into deps/:
#
#   From lib/amd64/  →  openmpt.lib
#   From bin/amd64/  →  libopenmpt.dll
#                        openmpt-mpg123.dll
#                        openmpt-ogg.dll
#                        openmpt-vorbis.dll
#                        openmpt-zlib.dll

`deps/` is in `.gitignore` — do not commit DLLs or the import library.

### VS Code workflow

The project deliberately avoids `cppvsdbg` launch configurations for running
the app.  `cppvsdbg` injects a debugger into every process it spawns, which
breaks raw-mode TUI applications (crossterm / ratatui) on Windows regardless
of the `console` setting.

**`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` override**

The system-level `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` environment variable may redirect cargo
output outside the workspace (e.g. `D:\rust\cargo`).  All tasks override it to
`${workspaceFolder}/target` so that `launch.json` and the DLL pre-flight check
can use a fixed, predictable path.

**Running** — use tasks, not F5:

| Task | Default? | What it does |
|------|:--------:|-------------|
| `build (tracker)` | ✅ | `cargo build --features tracker` |
| `run (tracker)` | ✅ | Build with tracker → launch in new console window |
| `run (release, tracker)` | | Release build → launch |
| `build` | | `cargo build` — no tracker, works without DLLs |
| `run` | | Build without tracker → launch |

Trigger via **Terminal → Run Task** or bind `Ctrl+Shift+P → Tasks: Run Test Task`.

**Debugging** — `launch.json` only contains attach configs:

```
F5 → Attach to cmp (debug) → pick the running cmp.exe process
```

Start the app first via a run task, then attach.

### Data files

All three files live in the same platform-specific config directory:

| Platform | Directory |
|----------|-----------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\console-music-player\` |
| Linux / macOS | `~/.config/console-music-player/` |
| Termux | `~/.config/console-music-player/` |

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `config.json` | Source directories, Amazon cookie and download dir |
| `tags.json` | User keyword tags per track path |
| `playlists/{name}.json` | Track path list per named playlist (one file each) |

### iTunesDB / iTunesSD internals

All DB writes go through `ipod_rs::atomic_write`, which writes to a `.tmp`
sibling file and renames atomically.  This prevents partial writes from
corrupting the iPod database if the process or power is interrupted.

The `scan_health` function in `ipod-rs/src/detect.rs` was refactored from
O(n²) to O(n) — it builds a `HashSet<u32>` of master-playlist correlation IDs
in a single DB pass, then checks each track against the set.

### Adding a new audio format

1. If the format has a pure-Rust decoder on crates.io, add it to the
   `symphonia` features in `Cargo.toml` — `player/mod.rs` picks it up
   automatically via the `Decoder` path.
2. Add the file extension to `LOFTY_EXTENSIONS` in `library/scanner.rs`.
3. Add magic-byte detection for it in `library/magic.rs` (`detect_format`).
4. If it requires a C library, model it after `tracker/`:
   - Add an optional feature in `Cargo.toml`
   - Gate the dep and implementation behind `#[cfg(feature = "...")]`
   - Add a `/DELAYLOAD` entry in `build.rs` for Windows
   - Add a `check_<lib>_dll()` probe in `main.rs`
   - Update `.cargo/config.toml` if the library needs special Android linkage
